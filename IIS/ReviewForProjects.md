My reviews and helpful reference links. Up til now, it is pretty easy course.

**Project1 - Man in the middle** </br>
This project somehow reminds me of the steam game Hacknet. The working process on this project is a bit suffering and kinda like a puzzle. I got stuck on part 2 for a long while. But overall it is fun. I finished the project in 6 hours, while few students completed the lab in 3 hours. I assume they are very good at wireshark and have some security background before the lab. </br>

The below references help me unstuck. I wish I could spot some links earlier </br>

**Project2 - Malware Analysis** </br>
This project can be better. It is cool to analyze the Joesandbox malware reports in part 1 and understand what behaviors different malwares result in. However, the part 2 is to read an old paper and twist some ML config. The approach doesn't look practical nor interesting. I did a quick scan of reports & paper and finished in 4 hours. However, if you only care about passing gradescope, you just need to be smart on guessing answers and can finish the entire project in less than 30 mins. </br>
