My reviews and helpful reference links. Up til now, it is pretty easy course.

</br>**Project1 - Man in the middle** </br>
This project somehow reminds me of the steam game Hacknet. The working process on this project is a bit suffering and kinda like a puzzle. I got stuck on part 2 for a long while. But overall it is fun. I finished the project in 6 hours, while few students completed the lab in 3 hours. I assume they are very good at wireshark and have some security background before the lab. </br>

The below references help me unstuck. I wish I could spot some links earlier </br>

</br>**Project2 - Malware Analysis** </br>
This project can be better. It is cool to analyze the Joesandbox malware reports in part 1 and understand what behaviors different malwares result in. However, the part 2 is to read an old paper and twist some ML config. The approach doesn't look practical nor interesting. I did a quick scan of reports & paper and finished in 4 hours. However, if you only care about passing gradescope, you just need to be smart on guessing answers and can finish the entire project in less than 30 mins. </br>

</br>**Project3 - Web Security** </br>
This project is about XSRF, XSS and SQL injection to a provided unsecured website. I never thought about these attacks and learnt a lot. Overall it is a good assignment. However, I do feel a lot of pain due to no previous experience on Javascript. In addition, tests are not available, which force me to check details on VM again and again.  It took me multiple nights to finish this project. </br>

</br>**Project4 - ML on CLAMP** </br>
This homework is a big distraction from Security itself and every task is basic ML implementation. I think it is one of the worst assignments I have had in this program: The quality of this assignment document is bad, some function descriptions are very unclear, and no local tests are provided for the majority parts. In addition, the GS tests usually provide no feedback on failed tests and the non-public test design is pretty silly; one design example is that One Hot Encoding value has to be 0.0/1.0 float format and GS test will fail silently if your value is 0 or 1. Even I am pretty familiar with all concepts and relevant coding, I spent 11.5 hours to pass all GS tests. My workload should reduce by at least half if the project is designed better. Let alone I didn't learn any security concepts from this project.</br>

</br>**Project5 - Cryptography (RSA)** </br>
Much more interesting project. Different attacks on RSA. Total 11.5 hours.
