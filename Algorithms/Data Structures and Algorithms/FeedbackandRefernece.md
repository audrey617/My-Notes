Use this seminar to review basic data structures and algorithms. So far, pretty basic.

Project1: build arraylist with basic array. <br>
Follow the homework instruction would be fine. I spend most time in setting up Java, Junit and required formatter in the VScode. Code part is fast. One mistake I had was not following the instruction closely. Had to adjust code to meet requirement in the end.<br>
