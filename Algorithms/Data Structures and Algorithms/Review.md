I use this seminar to review basic concepts so as to prepare graduate algorithm course. So far, pretty basic but the details are covered well in each module. 

Project1: build arraylist <br>
Follow the homework instruction would be fine. I spend most time in setting up Java, Junit and required formatter in the VScode. Code part is fast. One mistake I had was not following the instruction closely. Had to adjust code to meet requirement in the end.<br>
