This folder contains various notes and thoughts from the courses I am taking or took from Gatech. <br/>

Considering the copyright, I only set my notes to be public for the open courses available on Youtube, such as Advanced Operating Systems and Machine Learning. Lecture notes/reviews will not be shared for non-public courses. Please let me know if there is any concern. Thanks. <br/>
