## 1. Supervised Learning VS Unsupervised learning VS Reinforcement Learning
Supervised Learning = Approximation. Inductive bias.<br />
Unsupervised learning = Description<br />
Reinforcement Learning (Wiki): <br />
How intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward<br />

For optimization:<br />
supervised learning - label data well to find the function/ approximate function<br />
unsupervised learning - make up some criterion and then find a way to cluster data to scores well.<br />
reinforcement learning - try to find behavior that scores well<br />

## 2. Induction and Deduction
Induction: being from examples to a more general rule.<br />
Deduction: from a general rule to specific examples, like reasoning.<br />
inductive bias: <br />

<h1 id="2">SL1 Decision Tree</h1>

## 1. Terms definition
Instances: inputs, a row of data, an observation from domain <br />
Concept: A function mapping inputs to outputs<br />
Target concept: The actual answer/function we try to find<br />
Hypothesis class: The set of all concepts. All functions I am willing to think about. Could be all possible functions however that would be hard for us to figure out which one is the right one given finite data.<br />
Sample (Training set): A set of instances with correct labels<br />
Candidate: A concept that you think might be the target concept<br />
Testing set: A set of instances with correct labels that was not visible to the learning algorithm<br />

## 2. Representation VS Algorithm
