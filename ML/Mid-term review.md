# Module: ML is the ROX
1. Supervised Learning VS Unsupervised learning VS Reinforcement Learning
Supervised Learning = Approximation. Inductive bias.
Unsupervised learning = Description
Reinforcement Learning (Wiki): 
How intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward

For optimization:
supervised learning - label data well to find the function/ approximate function
unsupervised learning - make up some criterion and then find a way to cluster data to scores well.
reinforcement learning - try to find behavior that scores well

2. Induction and Deduction
Induction: being from examples to a more general rule.
Deduction: from a general rule to specific examples, like reasoning.
