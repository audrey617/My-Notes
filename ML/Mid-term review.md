### 1. Supervised Learning VS Unsupervised learning VS Reinforcement Learning
Supervised Learning = Approximation. Inductive bias.<br />
Unsupervised learning = Description<br />
Reinforcement Learning (Wiki): <br />
How intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward<br />

For optimization:<br />
supervised learning - label data well to find the function/ approximate function<br />
unsupervised learning - make up some criterion and then find a way to cluster data to scores well.<br />
reinforcement learning - try to find behavior that scores well<br />

### 2. Induction and Deduction
Induction: being from examples to a more general rule.<br />
Deduction: from a general rule to specific examples, like reasoning.<br />
inductive bias: <br />
