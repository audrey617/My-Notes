### 1. Supervised Learning VS Unsupervised learning VS Reinforcement Learning
Supervised Learning = Approximation. Inductive bias.<br />
Unsupervised learning = Description<br />
Reinforcement Learning (Wiki): How intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward<br />

For optimization:
supervised learning - label data well to find the function/ approximate function

unsupervised learning - make up some criterion and then find a way to cluster data to scores well.

reinforcement learning - try to find behavior that scores well

### 2. Induction and Deduction
Induction: being from examples to a more general rule.
Deduction: from a general rule to specific examples, like reasoning.
