**Linear Algebra**
1. Systems of equations: Complete/non-singular -> unique solution -> lines across at a single point -> non-singular matrix -> rows are linearly independent -> determinant(det A) != 0,  redundent/Singular -> inf solutions -> singular matrix -> rows are linearly dependent -> determinant ==0, Contradictory/Singular -> no solution</br>
2. Linear vs NonLinear: A linear function forms a straight line when it is plotted on a graph; and a nonlinear function does not form a straight line (it is curved in some way)</br>
