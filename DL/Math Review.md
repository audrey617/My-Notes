**Linear Algebra**
1. Systems of equations: Complete/non-singular -> unique solution -> lines across at a single point -> non-singular matrix -> rows are linearly independent -> determinant(det A) != 0,  redundent/Singular -> inf solutions -> singular matrix -> rows are linearly dependent -> determinant ==0, Contradictory/Singular -> no solution</br>
2. Linear vs NonLinear: A linear function forms a straight line when it is plotted on a graph; and a nonlinear function does not form a straight line (it is curved in some way)</br>
3. Matrix Row Reduction/ Gaussian Elimination: Row echelon form - a matrix is in echelon form if it has the shape resulting from a Gaussian elimination. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination</br>
4. Matrix Rank: Non-singular also means full rank (rank == row, rank = row - dimension of solution space, represent the piece of information). Simple way to calculate rank is to do row echelon form https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-rank.html </br>
