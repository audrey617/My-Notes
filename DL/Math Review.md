**Linear Algebra** : basic concepts, many are covered in high school math. Good to do a quick refresh, but not enough</br>
1. Systems of equations: Complete/non-singular -> unique solution -> lines across at a single point -> non-singular matrix -> rows are linearly independent -> determinant(det A) != 0,  redundent/Singular -> inf solutions -> singular matrix -> rows are linearly dependent -> determinant ==0, Contradictory/Singular -> no solution</br>
2. Linear vs NonLinear: A linear function forms a straight line when it is plotted on a graph; and a nonlinear function does not form a straight line (it is curved in some way)</br>
3. Matrix Row Reduction/ Gaussian Elimination/ Row echelon form /reduced row echelon form: A matrix is in echelon form if it has the shape resulting from a Gaussian elimination https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination</br>
4. Matrix Rank: Non-singular also means full rank (rank == row, rank = row - dimension of solution space, represent the piece of information). Simple way to calculate rank is to do row echelon form https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-rank.html </br>
5. Vector: Two very important components of vectors are their magnitude, namely their size and their direction.  Norm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)</br>
6. Dot product: L2 norm = sqrt(dot product(u,u)) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product</br>
7. Matrix multiplication: So in summary, you can look at a matrix product this way as multiplying two matrix, but you can also see it as combining two linear transformations into a third linear transformation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#:~:text=For%20matrix%20multiplication%2C%20the%20number,B%20is%20denoted%20as%20AB.</br>
8. Dot product versus matrix multiplication: Dot product is defined between two vectors. Matrix product is defined between two matrices. They are different operations between different objects. The connection - Matrix product take every possible combination of dot products between row and columns [link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2354047/dot-product-versus-matrix-multiplication-is-the-later-a-special-case-of-the-fir)</br>
9. Matrices as linear transformations: A linear transformation is a way to send each point in the plane into another point in the plane in a very structured way. </br>
10. The identity matrix: 1s in the diagonal and 0's everywhere else https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix</br>
11. Matrix inverse: The inverse matrix is precisely that matrix for which the product of the matrices is the identity matrix. In a linear transformation, the inverse matrix is the one that undoes the job of the original matrix, namely the one that returns the plane to where it was at the beginning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix </br>
